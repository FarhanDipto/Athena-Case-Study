# Athena Learning - Retool Case Study

This repository contains the submission for the Athena Internal Learning Dashboard case study.

## Overview

The project is a comprehensive internal dashboard built with Retool and backed by Google Sheets. It allows for student submission, administrative review, and analytics of concept explanations.

## Components

*   `athena-dashboard-retool-app.json`: The exported Retool application source file. This can be imported into a Retool instance to run the app.
*   `PROJECT_REPORT.pdf`: A detailed report covering implementation decisions, challenges faced, and potential future improvements.

## How to Run

1.  Create a new application in Retool.
2.  From the app menu (three dots), select "Import an app from JSON".
3.  Upload the `athena-dashboard-retool-app.json` file.
4.  The app will require connecting a Google Sheets resource with a schema matching the one described in the project report.
